- ðŸ˜„ Just a little something about myself:

  I'm an IT ethusiast looking to build my skills and knowledge in the industry to pursue my
   DevOps and Solutions Architect cloud goals. I have been in customer service roles for 4 years
   and 1 year of doing office management and other roles but none of them sparked my interest and
   passion as much as the tech industry have. It could be because I have always been around a computer from a
   young age whether playing video games or trying to fix issues that I caused (downloaded a virus
   file by mistake and trying to not have my computer get destroyed from it ðŸ˜„). Working in and with the
   cloud has been a fun and passionate journey for me (the satisfying feeling of finally getting
   my Terraform code to work is just amazing) which I will continue to improve and make myself better! ðŸ˜„

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on further enhancing my cloud skills and am enjoying the process! ðŸ˜„
- ðŸš€ I currently hold the following Certifications:
  - AZ-900 Azure Fundamentals
  - CLF-C02 AWS Certified Cloud Practitoner 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on SAA-C03 AWS Certified Solutions Architect as I continue to build my skills in 
      Terraform, Python and Linux.
