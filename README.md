- 😄 Just a little something about myself:

   I'm a passionate I.T ethusiast who enjoying building cloud architecture. Working in and with the
   cloud has been a fun and passionate journey for me (being able to deploy my infrastucture using
   Terraform is such a satisfying feeling) which I will continue to improve and make myself better! 😄
- 🔭 I’m currently working on further enhancing my cloud skills and am enjoying the process! 😄
- 🚀 I currently hold the following Certifications:
  - AZ-900 Azure Fundamentals
  - CLF-C02 AWS Certified Cloud Practitoner 
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on SAA-C03 AWS Certified Solutions Architect as I continue to build my skills in 
      Terraform, Python, Linux and Windows.
